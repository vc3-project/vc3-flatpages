date: 2018-10-25
tags: [presentations]

We presented the VC3 project at the CMS Offline and Computing Week 2018.
showing how today, CMS users can create spark clusters on demand using

the CRAB infrastructure with only user access level to the resource.
We also advertised we are accepting beta users.
